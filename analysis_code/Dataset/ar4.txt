Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, were buried in a private funeral service last week in Orange County, California, according to his death certificate.The funeral was at Pacific View Memorial Park in Corona del Mar on Friday, two weeks after the helicopter crash that killed them, said the document, published on Tuesday by the local Fox affiliate KTTV.The Los Angeles Times also reported the news.Kobe and Gianna "Gigi" Bryant were among the nine people who died in the helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, at the end of January. Kobe and Gianna's remains were returned to the Bryant family earlier this month. Kobe Bryant's death certificate listed his cause of death as "blunt trauma," describing the "time interval between onset and death" as "rapid," KTTV reported. A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board indicated that engine failure did not contribute to the crash, bolstering the theory that pilot disorientation amid heavy fog is most likely to blame. Kobe Bryant is survived by his wife, Vanessa, and his daughters Natalia, 17, Bianka, 3, and Capri, 7 months."Vanessa and the family wanted a private service to mourn their loss," a source told Entertainment Tonight. "The ceremony was extremely hard for everyone as it's still hard for them to grasp they lost two beautiful souls." A public memorial service at the Staples Center is planned for February 24, a date with significance for both Kobe and Gianna Bryant: February, the second month of the year, represents Gianna's No. 2 jersey, and 24 was one of Kobe's two jersey numbers with the Los Angeles Lakers.The memorial will also honor the seven other victims of the helicopter crash: Alyssa Altobelli, John Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, Payton Chester, Sarah Chester, Christina Mauser, and Ara Zobayan, the helicopter pilot.
