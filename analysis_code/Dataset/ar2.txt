The United States Congress has passed an emergency spending bill that will allocate US$8.3 billion for the country's coronavirus response. The House of Representatives passed the bill in a near-unanimous vote on Wednesday afternoon; the Senate followed suit on Thursday. The bill will provide more than $3 billion to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration for research on diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. Each US state will reportedly receive at least $4 million for state and local government response.The bill also includes a provision that will ensure an eventual vaccine is affordable. Other funding will support the global coronavirus response and provide support for small businesses that are struggling in the wake of the outbreak. The bill will now go to President Donald Trump to be signed.Elsewhere, the US National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia opened up a 'Rapid Response Research' funding mechanism for non-medical coronavirus-related research. Such calls are often used to explore the impacts of natural disasters, such as hurricanes and wildfires and allow for an expedited review of research proposals.
